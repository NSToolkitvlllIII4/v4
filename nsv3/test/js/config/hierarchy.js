// come first, then possible ones just below them, then anything marked "extra" (for example Google's public mentions).
// Inside those, paragraphs keep the sidebar order (js/config/networks.js) and then the order the accounts were added.
//
//   social            matched, then possible accounts on the named social networks (Facebook, Instagram, ...)
//   google            Google / public search engine results
//   other             Others (General, E-commerce, Classmates, Myspace, Mugshot, Zoominfo)
//   personal-page     \
//   business-page      |  pages and websites, on any network that offers them.
//   fan-page           |  The tier id is also the account type value stored on the account ("accountType").
//   personal-website   |
//   business-website   |
//   fan-website       /
//
// Not built yet: fan-page, personal-website and fan-website have a place here but no form option or wording.
// To add one, see "Adding a page or website kind" in README.md.
